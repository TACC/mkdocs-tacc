# TACC Core-Docs

(what could become) The Core Docs template &amp; theme used by TACC Portals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is **not** yet a working documentation site **nor** theme **nor** template. It is _currently_ just storage for public access to resources for all that from [TACC/TACC-Docs@v0.12.0](https://github.com/TACC/TACC-Docs/tree/v0.12.0).
