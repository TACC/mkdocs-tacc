# How to Deploy

Deploys currently rely on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/).

1. Run `mkdocs gh-deploy --force --theme tacc_readthedocs`.
2. Wait for [GitHub action](https://github.com/TACC/Core-Docs/actions) to complete.
3. Load https://tacc.github.io/Core-Docs/.
